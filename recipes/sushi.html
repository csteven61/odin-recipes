            <li>Drain rice.</li>
            <li>Cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>

            <li>Press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered (for easier sealing later).</li>
            <li>Dot some wasabi on rice, and arrange: smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice, about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
            <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed, and roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat.</li>
            <li>Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve.</li>
